### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking me out! 

I am <a rel="me" href="https://social.wildeboer.net/@jwildeboer">@jwildeboer@social.wildeboer.net</a> on Mastodon

I have moved my repositories over to [codeberg](https://codeberg.org/jwildeboer). The only two things that stay here are [MUCNumbers](https://github.com/jwildeboer/MUCNumbers) which is now a mirror of [MUCNumbers](https://codeberg.org/jwildeboer/MUCNumbers) over at codeberg and 
the aprly named [jwildeboer](https://github.com/jwildeboer/jwildeboer) repo with this content.

Thank you, Github, for your service over the past few years, but I have moved on to a place I feel more at home.
